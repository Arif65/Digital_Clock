**###Digital-Clock**

	                                                                                    
#This is a **console-based application** which I built up using **C programming language**.		                
The functions of this application are indifferent to the features of a simple digital clock.                  
                                                                                                                               
The application consists of **4 major section**:                                                                  
                                                                                                                               
**##1. Current Time:** 

In this section, the user will be able to select a region at first. All the regions i.e., the components of the world are included here.

After selecting a region, the user needs to choose a country of that region. **Almost 200 countries** are included from all of the regions. 	

And finally, the output i.e., current time will be displayed in either **12 hour or 24 hour format**. **Current day and date** will also be visible.				
                          
			
			
**##2. Timer:** 

It's nothing but the **countdown process**.                                        

The user can either set the time himself or select an option from the given list.	         	
                     
		     
					      
**###3. Stopwatch:** 

Here, the user can start **elapsing** time from zero and **lap** for multiple times.

Moreover, it is possible to **restart or pause** the stopwatch at any time.				
                    
		    
			      
**###4. Alarm:** 

There are **4 sub-portions** within this section:    

#i) to show the alarms that are set currently. 
	  
#ii) to set a new alarm.          
	  
#iii) to delete a specific alarm.   
	  
#iv) to delete all of the alarms at a time.	
	  
In addition, the user will be able to experience a realtime feature.  		                
He/She will hear a **beeping sound** for 10 seconds starting right at any alarm time with a notifying message regarding the alarm while viewing the current time of a country.
		 
		 
To better understand this application, I'll suggest watching the video representation that I attached with the files.
